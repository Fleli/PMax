Welcome to the PMax repository. PMax is a programming language that draws inspiration from C. It is built specifically with Hackerspace NTNU's [breadboard computer](https://github.com/hackerspace-ntnu/BreadboardComputer) in mind. While it might not match the sheer elegance of C or the power of Swift, PMax aims to provide an easy-to-use platform to make breadboard computer programming easier.

## Installation

Please refer to the [PMax Development Kit](https://github.com/Fleli/PDK-Installer) to install the compiler (this repository), an assembler and a virtual machine to develop and run PMax code.

## Documentation

The `Documentation`Â folder contains detailed information about each part of the compiler. A quick overview is found in `Documentation/Compiler.md`.

## Contact

I would love to hear from you if you have
- found a compiler bug, e.g. a `fatalError()` (`trap`) during compilation or incorrect assembly output
- an idea for a feature you would like to see implemented
- an idea related to optimization, either in the compiler or its generated code

You can either open an issue on the repository's GitHub page or send me an email:
