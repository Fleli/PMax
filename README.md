Welcome to the PMax repository. PMax is a programming language that draws inspiration from C. It is built specifically with Hackerspace NTNU's [breadboard computer](https://github.com/hackerspace-ntnu/BreadboardComputer) in mind. While it might not match the sheer elegance of C or the power of Swift, PMax aims to provide an easy-to-use platform to make breadboard computer programming easier.

## Installation

It is recommended to use the [Chad Package manager](https://github.com/Fleli/cpm) and run the command `cpm i pdk` to install PDK (PMax Development Kit), which includes the compiler, assembler, virtual machine and standard library.

## Documentation

The `Documentation`Â folder contains detailed information about each part of the compiler. A quick overview is found in `Documentation/Compiler.md`.

## Contact

I would love to hear from you if you have
- found a compiler bug, e.g. a `fatalError()` (`trap`) during compilation or incorrect assembly output
- an idea for a feature you would like to see implemented
- an idea related to optimization, either in the compiler or its generated code

You can either open an issue on the repository's GitHub page or send me an email:
