# PMax Compiler

Welcome to the PMax repository. PMax is a programming language that draws inspiration from C. It is built specifically with Hackerspace NTNU's [breadboard computer](https://github.com/hackerspace-ntnu/BreadboardComputer) in mind. While it might not match the sheer elegance of C or the power of Swift, PMax aims to provide an easy-to-use platform to make breadboard computer programming accessible. This repository performs source-to-assembly transformation. An assembler is needed to convert the assembly code to machine instructions. This will be announced once finished.

## Installation

Please refer to the [repository](https://github.com/Fleli/pmax) wrapping the compiler in an executable command-line application for installation instructions.

## Repository Structure

All code is found within `Sources/PMaxCompiler`. 

The folder `__main` provides the `Compiler` class, which represents the external interface for this repository. The `_Compiler` folder contains several definitions and functions that help the compilation, for example `FileOption`, a profiler and a pass manager.

The four folders `0Frontend`, `1PIL`, `2TAC`, and `3ASM` are also found within `Sources/PMaxCompiler`. These contain the actual code for source-to-assembly transformation. For further documentation on each pass, in addition to a future roadmap and a high-level compiler overview, please refer to the `_Docs` folder.

Finally, the `_Extensions` folder is used to extend existing types. An `SLRNode`Â extension is placed there in order to preserve it when SwiftParse and SwiftLex overwrites the frontend files.

## Standard Library

The standard library is being implemented in its own [repository](https://github.com/Fleli/PMax-StdLib). It will contain frequently used algorithms and data structures. Before the standard library can be used, however, the compiler needs to support an `import` statement and some infrastructure to "talk" to code outside the current source file.

## Further Development

I would love to hear from you if you have
- found a compiler bug, e.g. a `fatalError()` (`trap`) during compilation or incorrect assembly output
- an idea for a feature you would like to see implemented
- an idea related to optimization, either in the compiler or its generated code
