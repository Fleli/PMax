# Structure

PMax source code is organized as functions and struct declarations. A function is a group of code that is executed top-to-bottom. A struct is a type that represents a group of data.

All PMax programs **must** have a function with the signature `main() -> int`, for example
```
func main() -> int {
    return 2 + 2;
}
```
