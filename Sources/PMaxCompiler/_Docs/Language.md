## Language

The PMax programming language shares a lot of syntax and semantics with C. Some key similarities include:
- The `int` type being built in to the language
- Allowing the user to define _structs_ that group data together
- The widespread use of pointers for dynamic memory management
- The language is statically typed, but its typing system is weak and obeys the programmer's type casts

A more elaborate description of the language is in the works.
